## Objective

In this assignment, my objective is to delve into another application of the transformer architecture that I have built.

Upon completing this task, I will gain the ability to perform extractive Question Answering (QA) using the transformer model. I aim to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model to a custom dataset, allowing me to optimize its performance for specific QA tasks. To achieve this, I will implement a QA model in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, enhancing my proficiency in working with these deep learning frameworks for natural language processing tasks.
